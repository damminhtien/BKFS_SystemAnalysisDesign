# BKFA System Analysis & Design Template
*Online news management system** :newspaper:

This repository is a template of analysis and design system for software project. Its concept reference **Alan Dennis** , **Barbara Haley Wixom**, **David Tegarden**, **Systems Analysis Design UML Version 2.0 Book** and the course **Systems Analysis Design** in **Hanoi University of Science and Technology**

This follows:
* Systems Development Methodologies: **Agile**
* Approach: **Object-Oriented**
* Main concepts: **Use-Case Driven**, **Architecture Centric**, **Iterative and Incremental**

This project was created under StarUML app.

About SAD and UML:

Today, the cost of developing modern software is composed primarily of the cost associated with the developers themselves and not the computers. As such, object-oriented approaches to developing information systems hold much promise in controlling these costs. Today, the most exciting change to systems analysis and design is the move to object-oriented techniques, which view a system as a collection of self-contained objects that have both data and processes. This change has been accelerated through the creation of the Uni- fied Modeling Language (UML). UML provides a common vocabulary of object-oriented terms and diagramming techniques that is rich enough to model any systems development project from analysis through implementation.
